Hitting the trail in your 4x4 is similar to hiking the trail with a backpack. You'll survive longer with the more stuff you bring along, but you'll also have a harder time getting anywhere with too much gear on your or your truck's back. If you've never been wheeling before, then you'll likely fall into one of two categories-the guy that doesn't bring anything or the guy that brings every spare part under the sun. Either way you could be in for a rough trip. Here is a list of some recomended items to bring with you on your trip. You dont need to bring them all, but what you do bring will be all you have while your in the middle of nowhere, so plan accordingly.

Bare Necessities
You really should bring all of these things:
	A buddy with either a history in long-distance running to go get help, or his own 4x4
	Duct tape (fixes everything) 
	Baling wire (prehistoric duct tape)
	Zip-ties (modern-day duct tape)
	WD-40 (spraying under the distributor helps start trucks that have splashed through water)
	Ratchet strap (reseat tires, helps strap parts in place)
	Tow strap (useful if you get stuck or need to be drug home)
	Leatherman type utility tool and/or Swiss Army pocketknife
	Piece of 1/4-inch-or-larger chain 4 feet long (good for fixing suspension and motor mounts)
	Jug of water
	Warm jacket (being cold makes being stuck and broke worse)
	First aid kit (loss of blood makes trail repairs challenging)
	Granola bar or candy bar (food is important to survival, helps you think straight)
	Fire extinguisher (our friend watched his truck burn to the ground and then walked home)
	Flashlight (hard to walk home in the dark without one after your truck burns to the ground)
	Matches/lighter
	
Spare Parts
	These parts start adding weight, but it's better than the long walk home:
	Tie-rod end or Heim joints (spherical rod ends) for steering
	Heim joints for your custom linked suspension
	Engine belts
	Front axleshafts
	Rear axleshafts
	Front axle U-joints
	Driveshaft U-Joints
	Spare tire
	Spare locking hub or set of drive flanges
	Spare bolts of commons sizes found on your truck
	Fuses for your truck (some fuse panels have spaces to store spares)
	Radiator hose
	Hose clamps
	Electrical crimp kit
	Valve cores
	Lug nuts
	
What We Always Bring
If we're going wheeling for the day, this is a good list of tools and stuff to bring:
	Tool bag containing:
	Screwdrivers (three different sizes) 
	Pliers (Dikes, needle-nose, channel locks, snap ring, adjustable, locking grips)
	Hammer (ball-peen)
	Wrenches (standard and metric-we bring both, you decide what you need)
	Adjustable wrench
	Sockets (standard and Metric-we bring them, but often wrenches are enough)
	Spark plug socket
	Pick tools (handy for fixing hubs)
	Test light 
	Prybar
	Jack of some sort (Hi-Lift, bottle, or floor-depending on the terrain and size vehicle you own)
	Tire repair kit
	Electrical tape
	Allen wrenches
	Hacksaw
