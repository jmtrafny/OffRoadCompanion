When Off-Roading, it is important to remember that no matter where you go you are a guest. Be it a property owner, the Forestry Service and National Parks System, or even Nature in general, you are always on someone else’s land. Therefore it is important to be respectful and to practice good trail etiquette so that we may preserve the land for others to enjoy. Below are a few tips to help keep you and the land you travel safe while your on the trail.

•	Know and understand all land use guidelines for the area you plan to be in.

•	Familiarize yourself with all posted sings, markers, and flags as well as their respective meanings.

•	Obey all posted signs, markers, flags, and warnings.

•	Tread lightly. Always stay on the posted trails, never attempt to blaze a new trail without express permission from the land owner.

•	Leave no trace. Pack in what you pack out. If you encounter trash while on the trail, pick it up and dispose of it properly.

•	If you plan to engage in other activities while on the trail (shooting, camping, swimming, etc.) remember to clean up when your done. That includes policing your brass, spreading your ash and coals (ONCE THEY ARE COOL TO THE TOUCH), and collecting any floating debris you may have generated.

•	Remember to close any gate you may have opened. Gates are closed for a reason.

•	Remember to yield the right of way to motorbikes and ATVs, they are faster than you and will get out of your way once they have passed you.

•	If you come across a rider on a horse take caution. Horses are easily spooked and may injure the rider if they become so. If the horse is approaching you, pull off to the side of the trail and shut your engine off and wait for them to pass. If you are approaching the horse, give the horse a wide birth and wait for the rider to let you pass.

•	If you are in a group, let oncoming traffic know how many people are in your group.

•	When encountering traffic on a hill, the driver coming up the hill always has right of way.

•	Always leave a minimum of 5 jeep lengths between you and the vehicle in front of you.

•	Be mindful of your dust cloud. Blinding others as you go by is a recipe for disaster.

•	Don’t let your ego get the best of you, there is no shame in being winched off an obstacle. Similarly, don’t be ashamed of taking a bypass. The fun stops when the breakage starts.

•	If you see someone in need of assistance, stop and offer help. 

•	As members of the off-road community, we never leave a man behind. You’re not out until all your buddies are out too.
